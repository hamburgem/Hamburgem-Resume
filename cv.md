# Simple Personal Portfolio

A clean, responsive personal portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It includes sections for Home, About, Projects, and Contact, with smooth scrolling and a mobile hamburger menu.

## Getting started
- Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve the folder with any static server.
- Replace placeholder text and images with your own content.

## Customize
- Global styles live in `styles.css` (colors, spacing, typography).
- Update the site title and meta description in `index.html`.
- Replace placeholder images (currently from `https://picsum.photos`) with your assets.
- Edit section content in `index.html`: `#home`, `#about`, `#projects`, `#contact`.

## Notes
- Smooth scrolling is CSS-powered and works in modern browsers.
- The contact form is a demo (no backend). Connect it to your backend or a service like Formspree.
